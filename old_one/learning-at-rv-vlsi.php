This gives our students an ability to ramp up with a short “TTP” – “Time to be Productive” when inducted into live projects in the companies they get hired to.</span></p>

                            <p class="face back"><span>We follow an approach of Participative and Experiential Learning, where students are not merely receiving knowledge rather they get to co-create knowledge with the trainers through ”In Class” sessions and Lab sessions.
The Knowledge of a Concept is first inculcated in them through “In Class” sessions and discussions followed by application of the concept to a practical design scenario in the Lab sessions. The hands on Lab sessions are designed to make students explore the various dimensions of a concept in a design scenario. Subsequently they develop the ability to apply concepts to more complex design scenarios through Live Projects they get to work at, as a part of the program curriculum</span></p>
