							At RV-VLSI, I got ample exposure to VLSI technology, though I have an industry experience of 7 years. The content of the 
ADAD program is exciting and helped to fll the black boxes I had about the ASIC fow.  Learning VLSI was fun with the 
knowledgeable and friendly staff. Today I work with Intel

							I have completed my ADAD from RV-VLSI and have been selected by INTEL. But for the training in RV-VLSI, I would not have 
made it to INTEL. The training flled the gap between my academic B.E degree and expectation of the industry in respect of 
technical and soft skills

							Sir this is Varun from B-14 batch , this mail is to inform you that its almost a month in San jose now and i'm happy to say that i have slowly started to settle down. Classes have started and they are going great. Classes here are far different from the one which i had at RV-VLSI , here professors just do things at a rapid pace and expect us to know things . At this point i must say that RV-VLSI has helped a lot and i am knowing the importance of it when the whole class sits thinking of a problem where im able to finish the same in minutes, actually has given me  confidence over the subject.Lat week  looking at the projects (AMBA Protocol, DDR3, I2C , Standard Cells...) even my Academic adviser was astonished that in a short span of a 6 months we are thought on so many different areas . I remember the day in January 2011 when i met you for the first time and the advice you have given me. Today il tell it from my heart that you have given me more than what you promised and im really happy about that "THANK YOU SIR" also i will never forget  your classes , your scoldings and the silly questions i used to ask you (sorry sir if that had irritated you in class :) ) and the line "One Should Know how to Handle his Freedom" understanding the real meaning of it when im in place  where i don't have my family members , friends or someone to care for me. I will always follow that and focus on the purpose im here for.  Let God give you and your family good health and all the  happiness

							Namasthe Venky Sir,

Thank you for giving me a wonderful opportunity to complete the ADAD Course at RV-VLSI.

Currently, I am doing my Fall semester at University of Southern California.As you know I am pursuing Masters in Computer Architecture and Digital VLSI. I recently had a career fair at my university and had a very good experience speaking with hiring managers.

I had an opportunity to speak with recruiters from Intel, San Disk, Micron Technology,  Cypress Semiconductors and Altera. Even tough I had done many good projects at USC like Tomasulo OoC Processor, Chip Multi Threaded Processor, Layouts for PLL operating at 1GHz and 16 bit CLA using Domino Logic, companies were more interested in the Physical Design Project. All the recruiters asked me questions related to Physical Design, Synopsys IC Compiler and STA.They were impressed about the course work of the Institute.

Even in my Masters course work, the concepts taught at RV-VLSI was very helpful

							As a student I did not know what attributes to look for in a training institute before joining. After I joined RV- VLSI, I understood the 
importance of good infrastructure, access to EDA tools and expert faculty in VLSI training, and also how crucial these parameter s  
are for transforming an engineer into a productive professional

							The industry-like setting, with expert faculty has been a truly enriching experience. The training lays greater emphasis on 
concepts and practical skills. Its been a great learning experience on the whole. I think RV has provided me a frm foundation for 
a successful career in VLSI.

							The teaching methodology followed by the faculty here is very effective. The course is designed to bridge the gap between 
academia and industry and to make one productive very quickly. With coaching from Industry experts, exposure to all kinds of 
tools, virtual industry environment makes RV-VLSI a class apart. I have been successfully placed in Cypress Semiconductors as 
CAD engineer.  RV-VLSI is more of a learning and design center than a training institute.

unique and covers the latest industry trends, besides providing insights into the working of companies in the embedded systems 
domain. I have gained much from the course

offered by RV-VLSI and  was inspired by the course details. I have learned a lot from this course and we got hands-on practical 
training. I feel very happy that I am one of the fortunate persons to do the embedded course which has helped me get a job
