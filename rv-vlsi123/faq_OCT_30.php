							<div class="CollapsiblePanelTab">How is VLSI different from Software?</div> 
							<div style="display: block; visibility: visible; " class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
VLSI is about designing microprocessors and other cool integrated circuits (ICs) like modems, Networking chipsets, Telecomm chipsets, Graphics chipsets, Memories for computers etc. ICâ€™s which have multi-million transistors in them are classified as VLSI chips or VLSI designs. Whereas Software is about developing software applications involving coding, testing and programming.

							<div class="CollapsiblePanelTab">There is a worldwide downturn, is the VLSI industry affected?</div> 
							<div style="display: block; visibility: visible;" class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
		Yes, the VLSI industry is consumer driven and downturns are not new to India - remember the slowdown that hit us after Y2K. The good news is, downturns will be there but things turn around and get better than before. New players will enter the market -place, new opportunities will be created and the economy will start to grow.

							 <div  class="CollapsiblePanel "> 
							<div class="CollapsiblePanelTab">What is the best thing to do in a downturn ?</div> 
							<div style="display: block; visibility: visible;" class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
	Great question!! In short do something!! Take advantage of the times you are in. In the US people enroll into industry oriented programs during such periods to retrain and update their skills. Companies hire trained talent that can be productive quickly. RV-VLSI programs are designed to make you productive in a short time. Enquiries from companies for trained talent has been steadily rising at RV-VLSI.							</div>

							<div  class="CollapsiblePanel "> 
							<div class="CollapsiblePanelTab">Are all VLSI Companies the same?</div> 
							<div style="display: block; visibility: visible; " class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
	
 No, all VLSI companies are not the same. They may be classified as product companies, service providers who hire well qualified talent and depute them to work on design projects of their customers; and EDA companies who design software which is used by product companies to design chips. Further companies differ in size; some are small start ups, some are small companies in niche areas whereas others are medium or large companies. Major world renowned VLSI companies have their operations in India and particularly concentrated in Bangalore in a big way.

							 <div  class="CollapsiblePanel "> 
							<div class="CollapsiblePanelTab">What opportunities are available in VLSI?</div> 
							<div style="display: block; visibility: visible; " class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
VLSI offers great opportunities in chip design in the areas of ASIC, FPGA design and Custom Layout design. The job opportunities are in Front End- RTL design and Coding, Verification, synthesis, Implementation, Static Time Analysis, and Design for Test. The Back End jobs are - Physical design, Custom Layout, Place and Route. About 120 VLSI companies operate in India and the number is growing. These companies are concentrated in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Noida. Other cities such as Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Mumbai, Cochin are fast catching up.

							<div class="CollapsiblePanelTab">I am a BE in Electronics & Communications with a software job offer. Should I take it up?</div> 
							<div style="display: block; visibility: visible;border:0; " class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
A.	This is really a question for you to take a call. Take up a job where you get an opportunity to utilize your core knowledge learnt in engineering or diploma and you will be more valuable with time to employers. You may find it surprising but there are many VLSI positions which require software programming skills which engineers have, that go unfilled. To be precise about 60% of openings in VLSI today require engineers with programming skills. Do you have the passion to make a career in VLSI? If the answer is yes, you should go for it (send us an email and we will be happy to provide free counseling to you so you can take an informed decision) and not any software job which is not related to your engineering discipline. Remember that you have graduated in electronics & electrical engineering, but software is about coding and designing software application or QA of software. Any non-engineering graduate can take up a software job with some training, but not a job in VLSI for sure.
