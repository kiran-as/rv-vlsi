           We teach VLSI and Embedded Systems design concepts using a hands-on or experiential learning approach.
Initially the theory classes are about two hours per day followed by experiments and concept labs. Once the modules on design concepts are complete, every
Student will work on many mini projects followed by a project of industry importance as their final assignment. Upon successful completion of the assignment a
Diploma/Advance Diploma is awarded. Our diplomas are widely accepted by the industry for placements in core industries.
